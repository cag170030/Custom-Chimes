<p>Solid-bar wind chimes are the highest-pitch and lightest-weight chimes I make. They ring freely in gentle breezes and produce an unobtrusive, ambient sound that offers the same harmonic span as larger chimes (with more timbral richness). Please see my latest project involving solid-bar wind chimes <a href="http://chiragokani.org/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote><i>Chirag's wind chimes hang outside on my balcony and make me grateful every time there's a breeze--they are lovely to listen to, with a gentle and clear sound, and I have received compliments from numerous neighbors looking for a set. I keep them next to my hammock on the balcony and it is truly a peaceful happy place to sit!</i></blockquote>
